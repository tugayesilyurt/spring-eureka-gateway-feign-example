# Docker Compose Spring Eureka,Spring Cloud API Gateway,FeignClient

## Run the System
We can easily run the whole with only a single command:

* `docker-compose up`

The services can be run on the background with command:

* `docker-compose up -d`


## Stop the System
Stopping all the running containers is also simple with a single command:

* `docker-compose down`


If you need to stop and remove all containers, networks, and all images used by any service in <em>docker-compose.yml</em> file, use the command:

* `docker-compose down --rmi all`
